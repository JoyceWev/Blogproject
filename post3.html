					<h3>- Get clutter out of the way -</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="article_text">
					<p>In our previous post we talked about coherency, how to style your apartment in order to tie everything together. This post we will talk about de-cluttering your house. A lot of stuff in your house might make it seem more cosy and personal, but will quickly make your room feel cluttered, especially in smaller living spaces. To be sure you’ll embrace the rule of cohesiveness, be sure to store everything away that is not in line with the color palette of your house. Be sure you’ll have enough storage space to store everything away, or do a seasonal cleaning to throw everything out that is not needed anymore. A good option is to go for customized storage space. Bespoke built-ins, storage nooks, and furniture tailored to your exact needs can utilize every available sliver of space. When they're part of the walls, you don't lose nearly as much valuable square footage. And extra storage under a bench helps, too.</p>
					<br>
					<h5>Cleaning up</h5>
					<p>Look at your interior, now back to the pictures, now back to your interior. What do you see? You might notice that all the stuff inside your house does not really fit in your styling pallette. Meaning it is not coherent. Maybe colors that pop out, do not fit or just different styling in general. Now, you don't have to throw stuff away neceserally, but in order to give your limited space a spacey feeling less is indeed more. Try to clean up the things that don't fit to your interior. is everything you own really necessary? Try to get as minimalistic as possible. Of course you don't have to throw away ALL your stuff (especially since more assesories do give a more atmospheric feeling), but it certainly helps to give overview in your house and a more spacious feeling. Especially assessories, stuff or even furniture that is not needed or don't fit inside your styling palette, consider restyling them, selling them, giving them away or throwing them out.</p>
					<br>
					<h5>Vast amount of closet/storage space</h5>
					<p>You can never have enough closet space. try to get enough closet space in your house by getting more closets. You don't need to buy more, you can get creative yourself. Big tip for small spaces: if you don't have more floor room, try to go vertical. and get creative with every nook you can fill with possible closet space (for example closets build around doors). If you really don't have more space to hide away those ugly pieces, try to basket it up. Boxes, baskets, you name it, as long as it fits in the style of your house, place it somewhere and put away your cluttery stuff. above are some good examples of how boxes hid away unnessecary stuff.</p>
					<br>
					<h5>Display's and closed cabinets</h5>
					<p>Now, you don't have to hide away all your stuff. As said before, you might have some stuff, pieces or assesories that you either love to display or you feel like they add to a more atmospheric feeling of your house. plants, statues, pictures, you are not gonna put those away! But also service, cooking utensils or even basic products like soap or just everything that is needed throughout the day. You are not going to grab it every time out of a cabinet. Now this is where it gets tricky, you want them assesible easily, but those items can be a thorn in the idea. Look above how they fixed it. Books, for example, are turned around in order to not display the covers. Not very usable, but you can also recover them. Things for the bathroom? Make sure they fit! Towels in the same color, or get new packages for soap dispensers, or a set soap dispenser that has a colour that fits in your interior. It's true, it takes a while if you want to buy new stuff and restock it all. But it's worth it in the end. If you're looking at your bedroom, you might have some clothes displayed. Now you won't throw out the clothes that don't fit in your styling pallette, but you can hide them in your closet. The clothes that might be displayed, be sure they fit your style, and maybe even arrange them based on color. If you have some items that you might wear for a second day. Make sure not to put them on 'the chair' (yes we all have them), but reserve some closet space for re-using clothing. Now for the kitchen, you can also expose all your foods, or put away ugly packages. You can also fill everything in a mason jar: mason jar's are a great example of getting a more coherent element inside your kitchen, but are still very useful. Now as a last tip, if you have finally sorted out what can be displayed and what is going to be stored away, make sure you don't overstuff your bookshelves. If you look at the pictures above, most shelves are nut totally full. This gives a more spacious feeling for your home. This is why it's so important to do a great clean up every once in a while.</p>
					<br>
					<h5>Effect of more and less stuff</h5>
					<p>I've already briefly discussed it, but if you display a lot of stuff it can get very cluttered very quickly (even if it all fits into your styling pallete!). That's why we advice to leave some space on the "display shelves", and especially on top of tv-stands, coffee tables or cabinets. The effect of less stuff displayed gives a feeling of more rest and, again, spaciousness.</p>
