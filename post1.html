						<p>Small living spaces tend to feel too full very fast. Try to keep the environment empty and clear. This blog post starts off with our rule-set to small spaces, to make most out it. Every month after that we will go into detail about each rule. Happy styling!</p>
					</div>

						<h5>Keep it Cohesive</h5>
						<p>There are only so many things to look at in a small space, so make sure they all fit. Stick to a limited color palette, whether it’s light and airy or dark and dramatic. Looking at items with an editor’s eye will help make sure pieces really belong and keep the space from becoming cluttered. As a final touch, look for one color that combines all your pieces together. This color can pop or be just a natural color, whatever you want your living space to emit.</p>

					<div class="article_styling textblock3">
						<h5>Work Minimalistic, go bigger but fewer</h5>
						<p>It may seem counterintuitive, but outfitting a small space with just a few large-scale pieces (rather than a mishmash of pint-size furniture) can actually make it feel grander. Resist the urge to push all of your furniture up against the walls. If you create space behind the furniture, it makes the room look wider than it is. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="article_styling textblock4">
						<h5>keep colours natural and clean</h5>
						<p>Calm, even-toned rooms fool the eye into thinking they're more spacious than they are. Make sure to add a variety of textures to keep the space from falling flat. You can always go black, or work with darker colours but be aware those will make the room feel smaller.</p>

					<div class="article_styling textblock5">
						<h5>Get clutter out of the way</h5>
						<p>To be sure you’ll embrace the rule of cohesiveness, be sure to store everything away that is not in line with the color palette of your house. Be sure you’ll have enough storage space to store everything away, or do a seasonal cleaning to throw everything out that is not needed anymore. A good option is to go for customized storage space. Bespoke built-ins, storage nooks, and furniture tailored to your exact needs can utilize every available sliver of space. When they're part of the walls, you don't lose nearly as much valuable square footage. And extra storage under a bench helps, too.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="article_styling textblock6">
						<h5>Focus on right lighting</h5>
						<p>Small spaces can often end up feeling dark due to small or nonexistent windows. Make up for the lack of natural light by adding plenty of light sources in every room, from the kitchen to the bedroom. Combine striking ceiling fixtures—either a pretty pendant or elegant flush mount, depending on your ceiling height—with sconces or table lamps for a cozy and bright atmosphere.</p>

					<div class="article_styling textblock7">
						<h5>Work with mirrors</h5>
						<p>Mirrors have multiple pro’s attatched to them: If you’re not blessed with an abundance of natural light, mirrors can help you make the most of what you do have by reflecting it around the room. Mirrors can also help make the space feel bigger, giving the illusion of a few more square feet. Consider lining a wall with a large mirror or creating a gallery wall of different sizes and shapes.</p>
