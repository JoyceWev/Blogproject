               <p>These are examples of interiors where it all comes together, natural colors, popping colors, pastel or dark: there is a focus on bringing back together all parts of the interior into a whole. Notice that it is not necessary to cut down on the stuff: as long as it fits in the whole picture.</p>

               <p>There are only so many things to look at in a small space, so make sure they all fit. Stick to a limited color palette, whether it’s light and airy or dark and dramatic. Looking at items with an editor’s eye will help make sure pieces really belong and keep the space from becoming cluttered. As a final touch, look for one color that combines all your pieces together. This color can pop or be just a natural color, whatever you want your living space to emit.</p>

               <h5>Light colored Interiors</h5>
               <p>A big pro of working with light colored and earthy colored interiors is that it is easier to fit everything together, get multiple assecories in and it will still look roomy and uncluttered and cozy. Since dark colours tend to make your room very small, for small living spaces it is adviced to use light and earthy colours. BUT, you are, of course, not restricted by it.</p>
               <br>
               <h5>Dark colored Interiors</h5>
               <p>In the examples stated above, you can see that even though dark colours are used, there is always a mixture of some light elements. Therefore we advice not to go all black (unless you <span>really</span> want that dramatic apartment). Dark colors can be used, but be cautious: dark colours do make everything seem and feel small. therefore less interior articles are adviced to still have a clean look.</p>
               <br>
               <h5>How to achieve coherence</h5>
               <p>If you're going for natural colors it is quite easy. Make sure you have a lot of wooden, reeds, leather or plant elements inside of your home. White and natural colors (brown or light brown colors) are easy found for interiors, just like assesories. Some assesories you can think of are books, plants wooden statues vases, candles, pictures and picture frames: there's a lot! But beware, books often have a poppy color cover, don't use it if it doesn't fit in your color palet. Try covering the books.</p>
               <p>Going for poppy colours? this doesn't need to be hard. Just be aware when buying or restyling things not to over do it. try to keep it calm but let the color come back in your apartment. Going for pastel? match flowers and pillow cases, maybe a blanket or a vase. More poppy? pillow cases all the way, and try to frame a poster in that same style/color. maybe, again, a vase. Assecories can really tie a place together but beware not to overdo it! Also, if you have an eyecatching piece with a poppy color, all the better. But in this case also, do not overdo it and try to place all items throughout the apartment in order to really tie everything together.</p>
               <p>If you place everything (whether you went for poppy colours or natural colours) through your apartment, it ties everything together. so therefor be sure everything fits inside your style/colour palate, otherwise you might have a nook that emits the atmosphere you want, but you won't have your whole house to do so. You can switch for each rome it's colour pallete if you want to, but we advice to keep it the same for each room, however.</p>
               <p>We hope these advices helped you out to tie everything in your home together. Happy styling!</p>
